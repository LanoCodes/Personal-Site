# Personal Site
This project is a mockup of a what my personal site could look like.

## Installation
1. Create a directory on your machine to house my site. I find something like "Delano's Site" to work well!
```commandline
mkdir Delano's Site 
```
2. Look above on this page and select "Code"
3. From here, copy HTTPS web URL
4. Return to your terminal and clone the repo.
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/LanoCodes/Personal-Site.git
```
5. Open the Delano's Site  folder.
6. From here, using your favorite browser (but preferably Google Chrome), open the index.html file

## Usage
- In the tab that appears, you will be able to view the site that I've made by scrolling and interacting with the buttons present!
